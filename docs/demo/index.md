# Demo Reports

Live HTML reports generated by pytest-codingagents with [pytest-aitest](https://github.com/sbroenne/pytest-aitest) integration. These reports include AI-powered analysis, tool call diagrams, and cost breakdowns.

## Reports

| Report | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Basic Report](basic-report.html) | Core file operations — create modules, refactor code |
| [Model Comparison](model-comparison-report.html) | Same tasks across different models (GPT-5.2 vs Claude Opus 4.5) |
| [Instruction Testing](instruction-testing-report.html) | How different instructions affect agent behavior |

## How These Are Generated

Each report is produced by running integration tests with pytest-aitest:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_basic.py \
    --aitest-html=docs/demo/basic-report.html \
    --aitest-summary-model=azure/gpt-5.2-chat
```

Or use the per-file runner to generate all reports at once:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_all.py
```

See [pytest-aitest Integration](../how-to/aitest-integration.md) for setup details.
